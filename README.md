# ViBelt

This is the code for a belt that aids the blind in navigating around by providing them with an indication of what objects are near them. They also have the ability to turn off any given sensor in the event that they recognize the object near them. 
With the use of TinkerCad, I have made an online demonstration to which this code relates to. 

I have also created a video demonstrating how it works:
